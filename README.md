[iTokenProject.org](https://itokenproject.org) â€” Project Website for iTokens Blockchain Implementation

**Overview:** Peer-to-peer blockchain protocol on Ethereum where the total supply of coins is constantly decreasing through competitive staking. Over time each coin left becomes more rare, unlike almost all modern cryptocurrencies which have an ever increasing supply.

**More Info:**

 * Runs on Ethereum, Utilizing Plasma Chain Platform & Staking Through Casper Update
 * Full launch shortly after Proof-of-Stake is implemented into Ethereum protocol
 * We aim to be one step ahead, iTokens development started months before Ethereum implemented staking, all in anticipation of Ethereum's Casper Network in order to be first-to-market.
 * Proof-of-Stake turns competitive with "Risk-of-Loss".<br>Actively staked coins generate a net gain each block.
 * Our ICO is completley free, donations fund extensive development efforts. Contributors to our Open Source project are paid with iTokens!
